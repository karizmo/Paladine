          <h1 class="subheader">Songkran Festival</h1>
          <p>April is the hottest month of the year for Thailand.
          To cool down, Thai citizens throw water at each other to cool down.
          Though the real meaning behind this is to welcome the new year in the Thailand calendar.
          Many tourists come to celebrate the most colourful and festive time of the year with the locals on Bangkok streets.</p>

          <h1 class="subheader">Khao Kai Jeow</h1>
          <p>Along with Thai style rice congee soup (joke),
            one of the most popular things you’ll see eaten for
            breakfast in Thailand is khao kai jeow, meaning just
            rice and an omelet.

            Sometimes there are street food carts set up for exclusive
            omelet making, and there are a variety of ingredients
             that you can choose from, often including minced pork,
              onions, and a selection of other small vegetable ingredients.
              Once you make your selection, they will fry a fresh omelet,
              put it over the top of a bed of rice, and serve it to you with
               some ketchup tasting chili sauce on the side.

               You can also usually order a khao kai jeow at any Thai stir
               fry restaurant in the morning.</p>
