		<h1 id="taiwanHeader">Japan</h1>
		<p>If you are indeed travelling to Japan, you would actually be surprised of how Westernized Japan has become. A typical breakfast these days now, consists of bread, rice, or eggs, a meat product such as ham, bacon, or sausage, and a wide array of vegetables. Even after reading through blogs and websites, most japanese citizens usually make up an ideal type of breakfasts for themselves.
		<br>
		<br>
		A traditional Japanese breakfast is somewhat different from other kind of breakfasts around Asia. It can consist of foods that could be conceivably enjoyed during lunch or dinner. Any traveller who visited Japan may have encountered a breakfast that may have a piece of grilled fish, miso soup, onsen tamago, nori, and japanese pickles.</p>

		<h1 class="typeFood">Grilled Fish (Yakizakana)</h1>
		<p class="infoFood">Yakizakana is a term for Japanese style grilled fish that is often served whole. Although japan is known best for their raw fish menus, Yakizakana is by far a more common dish than sushi in the lives of most people in Japan. If you travel to Japan, you will likely encounter this in regular meals. The fish is either broiled in the oven or cooked in a pan and simply seasoned with salt.</p>

							<p id="taiwancultInfo">Funny how when you slurp your food in Western cultures can be deemed as rude and impolite. Soups and noodles to many are meant to be eaten in a very polite matter which can make it a nuisance. However, in Japan when you slurp on noodles and soup, it is seen as complementary to the chef, so slurp away if you find yourself enjoying the noodles in Japan.</p>
